Exhibit 10.20

LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENT

This Local Marketing Agreement (the “Agreement”) dated as of March 15, 2001 is entered into by and between LIBERMAN BROADCASTING OF HOUSTON, INC., a California corporation (the “Owner”), which upon the Effective Date (as defined below) shall be the owner and operator of KSEV(AM), Tomball, Texas (the “Station”), which, upon the Effective Date, will be licensed to its wholly owned subsidiary, Liberman Broadcasting of Houston License Corp., and HOUSTON BROADCASTING COMPANY, L.P., a Texas limited partnership (the “Broker”).

WHEREAS, Owner will, upon the day that Owner consummates its acquisition of the Station (the “Effective Date”), which date shall be no earlier than March 20, 2001, be engaged in the business of radio broadcasting on the Station and will have available airtime;

WHEREAS, Owner wishes to retain Broker to provide programming for the Station pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in conformity with the Station’s policies and practices and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended together with the rules and regulations (the “FCC Rules”) of the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”); and

WHEREAS, Broker wishes to supply such programming and sell advertising that is in conformance with the Station’s policies and all FCC Rules, including the requirement that the ultimate control of the Station be maintained by Owner;

NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto have agreed and do agree as follows:

1. Purchase of Airtime and Provision of Programming. From the Effective Date until the date on which this Agreement expires or is earlier terminated, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Owner agrees to broadcast programming supplied by Broker 24 hours-per-day, 7 days per week provided that Owner may broadcast up to two (2) hours of programming per week which is aimed at serving the needs and interests of the Station’s community of license during the morning(s) of Saturday and/or Sunday in accordance with Section 11 of this Agreement.

To facilitate delivery of programming by Broker hereunder, Owner hereby grants to Broker the right for the first six months following the Effective Date, the right to use an on-air studio and on-air talk studio at the station’s studio (the “Studio Facilities”) located at 11767 Katy Freeway, Suite 1170, Houston, Texas 77079 (the “Studio Site”) and, subject to availability, for the first ninety (90) days following the Effective Date, the right to use production studios at the Studio Site at no additional cost to Broker. Broker and Owner shall negotiate in good faith to have Broker purchase the equipment used in the Studio Facilities once Owner relocates its studio to another site. Accordingly, Broker shall have, and Owner hereby grants to Broker, a license to enter on the premises currently occupied by the Station for the purpose of utilizing the Studio Facilities and the production studio. Broker shall hold Owner Parties (as defined below) harmless from all costs, fees and expenses incurred with respect to any personal injury suffered by any employee or agent of Broker while on the property of Owner. Broker also shall be responsible for and shall reimburse Owner for any damage to the property of Owner caused by Broker’s employees or agents. Additionally for a period of 30 days, and thereafter to the extent that Owner determines in its discretion that it has space available, Owner shall permit Broker to share the office space at the Studio Site which currently houses the station’s traffic equipment and additional office space which may be used for Broker’s sales manager and his assistant (collectively, the “Allocated Space”). Owner shall invoice Broker on a monthly basis for the




Allocated Space based upon a pro rata share of Owner’s lease payments for the Studio Site. In the event that Owner permits Broker to utilize the Allocated Space for longer than 30 days, Broker agrees to vacate the Allocated Space upon ten (10) days notice from Owner. Broker’s rights of access to the Studio Site (including the Studio Facilities and the Allocated Space) constitutes a temporary and non-exclusive right to occupy only and does not constitute a sublease or an assignment of any rights held by Owner with respect to such property.

Broker shall air the programming set forth on Exhibit A hereto (the “Programming Lineup”), which Exhibit A shall be provided by Broker for Owner’s approval on or before the Effective Date. Following the Effective Date, Broker shall not make any changes to the Programming Lineup without the prior written consent of Owner, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

2. Payments & Deposits. During the term of this Agreement, Broker shall pay Owner the payments and grant Owner such other consideration as, in each case, is set forth on Exhibit B hereto. All payments shall be made in advance in equal monthly installments due no later than the seventh (7th) day of each calendar month; provided, however, that on or before the Effective Date, Broker shall transfer to Owner by wire payment of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Owner a payment equaling the prorated monthly payment for March 2001 and the payment for April 2001 in the amount set forth on Exhibit B. All monthly payments shall be by certified or cashier’s check. In addition to monthly payments hereunder, concurrently with the execution hereof, Broker shall tender to Owner a deposit (the “Deposit”) in such amount as is set forth on Exhibit B. Said Deposit shall be refundable upon the expiration of the term of this Agreement. If Broker fails to make any of the payments called for by this Agreement, Owner may, but shall not be obligated to, draw on the Deposit to defray the payment owed. In such event, Broker shall within five (5) business days pay to Owner an amount necessary to restore the full amount of the Deposit before further programming may be aired. Owner, at its option, may treat the failure to make monthly payment or to replenish the amount on deposit when due as a breach of this Agreement and immediately terminate the Agreement.

Without limiting Owner’s rights and remedies under Section 16 or any other provision of this Agreement, including its right to immediately terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 16.1.1, if Broker has not delivered any payment owing to Owner by the seventh (7th) day of the calendar month, Owner may, in its sole discretion, suspend the carriage of Broker’s programming and resell such broadcast time (a “Default Segment”). Broker shall remain liable to Owner for the difference between the amount payable by Broker pursuant to Section 1 for the broadcast time comprising the Default Segment during the remainder of the term of the Agreement and the amount, if any, received by Owner upon resale of all or part of the Default Segment to a third party during the remainder of the term of the Agreement.

The Broker shall receive a credit for any scheduled programming not broadcast by the Station under the powers of operation and preemption in Section 11, the amount of such credit to be equal to such percentage of the monthly payment amount as the amount of time preempted comprises of the total programming hours for such month. Such credit shall be Owner’s sole compensation to Broker for air time so lost. Owner shall have no other liability to Broker or any third party pursuant to the terms of this Section. Owner may treat the failure to make payment when due as a breach under paragraph 16.1 and terminate the Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement and without limiting other rights and remedies of Owner, any payment provided for in this Section 2 not made on the due date

2




shall be subject to finance charges at a rate equal to the lesser of (x) 12.0% per annum or (y) the highest rate allowed by applicable law, compounded monthly.

3.Accounts Receivable. Broker shall have no interest in any cash accounts receivable for broadcasts on the Station which occur prior to the Effective Date. All revenues and cash accounts receivable for broadcasts on the Station following the Effective Date shall belong to Broker except that those revenues and accounts receivable which relate to (x) the items specified as “Other Consideration” on Exhibit B hereto and (y) public affairs programming broadcast by Owner in accordance with Section 11 hereof shall, in each case, belong to Owner. Additionally, and for the avoidance of doubt, any other revenue derived from the operation of the Station or its facilities shall belong to Owner. Broker may sell advertising time consistent with the applicable rules and regulations and the Policy Statement (as defined below), on the Station in combination with any other broadcast station of its choosing, subject to compliance with applicable law. Broker shall be responsible for payment of the commissions due to any national sales representative, local sales representative, agency or employee engaged by it for the purpose of selling advertising that is carried during the programming it provides to Owner. Neither Broker nor any representative of Broker shall solicit the placement of advertisements by any advertising client to whom Owner has sold advertising on the Station.

4.Prohibition on Resale. Broker agrees that it will not resell or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the airtime purchased from Owner hereunder without the express prior written consent of Owner, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, any such sale or transfer without such consent being void and of no force or effect; provided, however, that Broker may resell airtime in blocks of no longer than three (3) consecutive hours without Owner’s prior written consent.

5.Program Delivery Requirements. Broker shall deliver programming at its expense to the Station’s transmitter facilities or other authorized remote control points as reasonably designated by Owner.

6.Term.

6.1Initial Term. The term of this Agreement shall be from date hereof until the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date unless sooner terminated as provided by this Agreement.

6.2Extension Periods. Broker shall have the option to extend the term of this Agreement for up to two successive one-year periods (each an “Extension Period”). In order to exercise such options, Broker shall (i) with respect to the first Extension Period, give written notice to Owner no later than six months prior to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date and (ii) with respect to the second Extension Period, give written notice to Owner no later than six months prior to the scheduled termination of the first Extension Period. Rates for the Extension Periods shall be as set forth on Exhibit B.

6.3Termination. At any time following the second anniversary of the Effective Date, Broker may terminate this Agreement upon six (6) months notice to Owner if it is Broker’s intent to cease operations (for the avoidance of doubt, the earliest point where Broker may give such notice to Owner is six (6) months prior to the second anniversary of the Effective Date). In the event that Broker exercises its rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this Section 6.3, if Broker, any affiliate of Broker, or any entity in which Dan Scott Goeb or William Michael Richards or either of their respective spouses holds, directly or indirectly, an ownership interest, at any time prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Date, (x) enters into a local

3




marketing agreement, time brokerage agreement or other agreement to purchase time on a radio station in the Houston DMA or (y) becomes the licensee of any radio station in the Houston DMA, (1) Broker’s termination of this Agreement shall be deemed to be null and void, (2) Broker shall be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement (a “Competition Breach”) and (3) Broker shall pay to Owner, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the fees which would have been due to Owner pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement had Broker performed its obligations hereunder from the date on which Broker terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.3 through the end of the initial term set forth in Section 6.1 or, if such event shall occur during an Extension Period, through the end of such Extension Period or any subsequent Extension Period for which Broker has exercised its option pursuant to Section 6.2 (the “Liquidated Damages”). The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that, due to the nature of the services provided, in the event of a Competition Breach, it would be extremely difficult or impossible to fix the actual damages, if any, which may proximately result from such Competition Breach, that an adequate remedy would be inconvenient and difficult to obtain, and that such Liquidated Damages represent a reasonable estimate of the loss to be sustained by Owner.

7.Station Facilities.

7.1Operation of Station. Throughout the term of this Agreement, Owner shall operate the Station with the maximum authorized facilities. Any necessary maintenance work affecting the operation of the Station which would result in a reduction of transmitter power by more than 7.5 kW daytime or .5 kW nighttime shall be scheduled upon as much prior notice to Broker as practicable and at night or during overnight hours. Owner reserves the right, subject to FCC authorization, to modify the facilities of the station as it determines is advisable in its sole discretion.

7.2Interruption of Normal Operations. If the Station suffers loss or damage to its transmission facilities for any cause other than one governed by Section 7.3, which results in the decrease in the station’s operating power by more than 7.5 kW daytime and/or more than .5 kW nighttime, Owner shall notify Broker and shall undertake such repairs as necessary to restore the operation of the Station within fourteen (14) days from the occurrence of such loss or damage. If Owner fails to return the station to normal operations with such fourteen (14) day period, the Broker will be entitled to decrease the payments called for in Sections 1 and 2 in proportion to the loss of power by more than 7.5 kW daytime and .5 kW nighttime. If Owner fails to accomplish that result within sixty (60) days, Broker may terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days notice to Owner.

7.3Force Majeure. Any failure or impairment of the Station’s facilities or any delay or interruption in the broadcast of programs, or failure at any time to furnish facilities, in whole or in part, for broadcast due to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, material or labor restrictions by any governmental authority, civil riot, floods and any other cause not reasonably within the control of Owner (including any obligation of Owner to reduce power or suspend operation to avoid occupational exposure to harmful RF radiation), shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement and Owner will not be liable to Broker.

8. Programming Standards. All programs supplied by Broker shall be in good taste and shall meet in all material respects all applicable rules, regulations and policies of the FCC and the standards set out in Exhibit C of this Agreement (the “Policy Statement”). All advertising spots and promotional material or announcements shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations and policies. The program may not disserve the public interest, as determined by Owner. If, in the sole judgment of Owner, the programming presented by Broker

4




does not meet such standards, Owner may suspend or cancel any such program. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6 and 17.2, if Owner cancels more than four (4) programs under this authority within any three (3) month period, Owner may immediately terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement based on Broker’s material breach thereof. The provision by Broker of any programming, announcement, advertising or other matter that is slanderous, defamatory, obscene or indecent and therefore in violation of the Policy Statement, or that is otherwise in violation of the Policy Statement, shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, and shall entitle Owner, at its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement immediately and exercise its rights and remedies under this Agreement based on such material breach by Broker, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6 and 17.2. If Owner determines, in its sole discretion, that any programming, announcement, advertising or other matter provided by or on behalf of Broker for broadcast on the Station may be slanderous or defamatory, Owner may require any retractions or related material that may be appropriate, as determined in the sole discretion of Owner, to be broadcast on the Station hereunder without (i) creating any liability to Broker or any other third party or (ii) limiting Owner’s indemnification rights pursuant to Section 16, or any of its other rights pursuant to Sections 11 and 17, or any other provision of this Agreement.

9.Responsibility for Expenses and Employees.

9.1Division of Expenses. Owner will provide and be responsible for (i) the Station personnel necessary for maintenance and operation of the Station’s transmission facilities (including without limitation a Chief Operator), and will be responsible for the salaries, taxes, insurance and related costs for all Station personnel used in the maintenance and operation of the Station’s transmission facilities, (ii) such costs as are provided for in Section 9.2 and (iii) all real and personal property taxes, mortgage fees and expenses and other real property costs (including insurance), (iv) all transmitter site leases and any lease payments related to the Station’s studios located at 11767 Katy Freeway, Suite 1170, Houston, Texas 77079, (v) any utilities (excluding telephone charges), and (vi) all costs and expenses for the maintenance of all transmitter equipment, as determined by Owner in its sole discretion. Whenever on the Station’s premises, all personnel shall be subject to the supervision and the direction of Owner’s General Manager and/or the Station’s Chief Operator. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentences of this Section 9, Broker shall be responsible for all other expenses involved in the operation of the Station including, without limitation, (i) all operating expenses of the Station (including telephone expenses and expenses related to sales, marketing, promotion, advertising, billing and collections and traffic), (ii) all costs and expenses for maintenance of studio equipment, (iii) the employment and salaries, taxes, insurance and related costs for all personnel used in the production of its programming, including salespeople, traffic personnel (except that Owner will provide, subject to reimbursement from Broker, personnel to handle traffic during the first two weeks following the Effective Date in accordance with Section 1), board operators and programming staff and (iv) all copyright fees attributable to Broker’s programming broadcast on the Station, including, without limitation, all ASCAP, BMI and SESAC fees, and fees for any other necessary music performance rights, as determined in the sole discretion of Owner.

9.2Station Engineer. In the event that Broker employs Chuck McLeod (the “Engineer”), Broker shall provide Owner with the Engineer’s services on a part-time (13 hours per week) basis. The Engineer shall perform such tasks as Owner shall require and in a manner which is satisfactory to Owner, in each case, in Owner’s sole discretion. In the event that Owner requires the Engineer’s services for more than 13 hours in any week, Broker shall (subject to the Engineer’s unavailability due to scheduling conflicts arising from previously scheduled matters) make the Engineer available to Owner for such additional service. All time spent by the Engineer
