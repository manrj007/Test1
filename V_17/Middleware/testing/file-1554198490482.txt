During the term of this Agreement and for one year after its expiration or termination, MTI or its accountants may, upon 30 days’ prior notice to ev3, audit the accounting records of ev3 during the normal working hours to verify ev3’s compliance with the obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that MTI will not be entitled to conduct such audit more that once per year. 
12. Indemnity. 
Except for liabilities caused by acts of ev3 which are outside the scope of its authority under this Agreement or which are performed with gross negligence, MTI will indemnify, defend and hold harmless ev3 from and against any and all liabilities, losses, suits, claims, damages and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) based on claims arising out of or relating to (i) the manufacture, use, distribution, promotion or sale of the Products or (ii) the infringement by ev3 of any patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of any third parties with respect to the Products or Promotional Materials. ev3 will (i) notify MTI promptly of any such actual or potential claim; (ii) allow MTI to control the defense of the claim; (iii) cooperate in the defense of such claim and (iv) not settle such claim without MTI’s consent. 
13. Term and Termination. 
a. 
Term. This Agreement will become effective on the Effective Date and continue in effect until November 16, 2006, unless earlier terminated pursuant to paragraph 13(b). This Agreement will automatically renew for subsequent 2 year periods unless either party provides the other party written notice 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term of its intention not to renew. 

b. 
Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, without judicial or administrative notice or resolution, immediately upon notice to the other party, if: 

(i) 
the other party or any of its employees breaches any material obligation under this Agreement and such party fails to cure the breach within thirty days after receipt of written notice thereof. Failure by MTI to deliver Products in accordance with the schedule set forth in the forecast for more than three months during any one year period will be considered breach of a material obligation; 

(ii) 
either party ceases to conduct business in the normal course, is declared insolvent, undergoes any procedure for the suspension of payment, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or a petition for bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation is filed by or against it; or 




(iii) the direct or indirect ownership or control of the other party changes as follows: MTI may only exercise its right of termination under this Section in the event that Warburg Pincus (together with its affiliates) ceases to own or control at least 20% of ev3. ev3 may only exercise it’s right of termination under this Section if a third party gains control of MTI from, or subsequent to, Warburg Pincus (together with its affiliates). Control of MTI will be deemed to have changed to a third party if that party acquires control over more shares of MTI than Warburg Pincus controls at that point in time. For purposes of this Section, an initial public offering of a party will 
not be considered to create a right of termination under this Agreement. 
c. 
Termination for Failure to Meet Minimum Sales. MTI may terminate this Agreement, upon written notice to ev3 within 30 days following the conclusion of a fiscal year in the event ev3 fails to meet the Minimum Sales for the Direct Territory, unless, within 10 days of receipt of such termination notice, ev3 provides written notice to MTI of its intent to cure. If such notice is provided, the Agreement will not terminate if, within 180 days, ev3 cures such failure for that fiscal year and becomes current with respect to sales in the then-current year. 

d. 
Termination for MTI Change of Control. In the event of a change of control of MTI, MTI may terminate this Agreement, upon 90 days’ written notice to ev3 within 30 days of such change of control of MTI. 

e. 
Consequences of Termination. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason the parties will comply with the following termination obligations: 

(i) MTI will pay all due and outstanding amounts, as well as any amount that has not become due, the due date of which will be automatically accelerated to the date of expiration or termination of this Agreement. 
(ii) ev3 will, at MTI’s option, destroy or deliver to MTI or its designees all Promotional Materials within ev3’s possession or control. 

f. 
Survival. The provisions of Sections 3(c)(viii), 3(c)(ix), 3(d), 3(e)(viii), 3(e)(ix), 6-8, 10, 11, 12, 13(e), 14-22 will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.” 


14. Insurance. 
MTI will maintain product liability insurance in an amount sufficient to cover complete cost of product liability, regulatory and intellectual property liability with an insurance company rated at least A+3 by Best’s rating guide. ev3 will be named as an additional insured on such insurance policies. ev3 will maintain insurance in an amount sufficient to cover any ev3 warehousing facilities and to cover wrongful acts by ev3 in the distribution, sale and promotion of the Products. 
15. U.S. Export Restrictions. 
ev3 acknowledges that the Products and related information, documents and materials may be subject to export controls under U.S. Export Administration Regulations. ev3 will (i) comply with all legal requirements established under these controls, (ii) cooperate with MTI in any official or unofficial audit or inspection that relates to these controls and (iii) not export, re-export, divert or transfer any such item or direct products thereof to any country to which such transfer is prohibited by such export controls, unless ev3 has obtained the prior written authorization of MTI and the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
16. Force Majeure. 
Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in performing an obligation under this Agreement that is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as natural catastrophes, governmental acts or omissions, laws or regulations, labor strikes or difficulties or transportation stoppages. These causes will not excuse either party from paying amounts due to the other through any available lawful means acceptable to the other party. 
17. Notices. 
Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and either mailed by nationally recognized overnight courier, registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by express delivery service to the other party. All notices shall be sent to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer of such other party at the address set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement or at such other addresses or to such other persons as such party may previously have designated by written notice. Notice will be deemed to have been given upon receipt. 
18. Assignment. 
Except as otherwise provided, neither party may assign, delegate, subcontract or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations without the other party’s prior approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Either party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations, upon notice to the other party, to (i) a related company or to an unrelated party pursuant to a sale, merger or other consolidation, or (ii) a subsidiary provided that the assigning party execute a guarantee covering the subsidiary’s obligations after such assignment. 
19. Waiver, Amendment, Modification. 
Except as otherwise provided, any waiver, amendment or other modification of this Agreement will not be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. 
20. Severability. 
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, such holding will not affect the validity of the other provisions. 
21. Governing Law. 
This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota, excluding its conflict of laws principles. Any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the existence, validity, breach or termination thereof, whether during or after its term, will be brought in, and the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of, the state or federal courts sitting in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
